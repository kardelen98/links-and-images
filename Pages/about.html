        <li>Plan First</li>
        <p>To avoid falling into this trap,
            Unpacking players should take
            some time to have a look around <br>
            the entire house, open every drawer, and get a good idea of
            what space they have to work with before they<br>
            even think about opening their first box</p>
        <li>Items Canâ€™t Be Placed Randomly</li>
        <p>Once every box has been opened and every item has been placed, incorrectly arranged <br>
            ones will flash red. So, players should take the time to properly inspect every item <br>
            and think logically about where most people would place it in their house.</p>
        <li>Sometimes It's Easier To See Everything</li>
        <p>Because players will be unpacking boxes that they didn't previously pack themselves,<br>
            it can be a surprise to see which items come out of each box. This also adds a layer of <br>
            difficultly because players are essentially blind to what they'll be organizing. <br>
            Thankfully, for those that want to see the bigger picture first, Unpacking will allow <br>
            players to simply empty the entire contents of the box and then start placing them accordingly.</p>
