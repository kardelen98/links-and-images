        <li>Plan First</li>
        <p>To avoid falling into this trap,
            Unpacking players should take
            some time to have a look around <br>
            the entire house, open every drawer, and get a good idea of
            what space they have to work with before they<br>
            even think about opening their first box</p>
        <li>Items Canâ€™t Be Placed Randomly</li>
        <p>Once every box has been opened and every item has been placed, incorrectly arranged <br>
            ones will flash red. So, players should take the time to properly inspect every item <br>
            and think logically about where most people would place it in their house.</p>
